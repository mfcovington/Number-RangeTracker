# NAME

Number::RangeTracker - Keep track of numerical ranges quickly

# VERSION

Version 0.5.0

# SYNOPSIS

Create and modify ranges (three range syntaxes shown):

    my $range = Number::RangeTracker->new;
    $range->add( [ 1, 10 ], '11..20' );
    $range->remove( 6, 15 );

Output ranges, their complement, or integers within ranges
(differences between scalar and list contexts shown):

    $range->output;
      # Scalar context: '1..5,16..20'
      # List context:   ( 1 => 5, 16 => 20 )

    $range->complement;
      # Scalar context: '-inf..0,6..15,21..+inf'
      # List context:   ( -inf => 0, 6 => 15, 21 => +inf )

    $range->integers;
      # Scalar context: '1,2,3,4,5,16,17,18,19,20'
      # List context:   ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 )

Examine range characteristics:

    $range->length;              # 8
    $range->size;                # 10

    $range->is_in_range(100);    # 0
    $range->is_in_range(18);     # 1, 16, 20

# DESCRIPTION

An instance of the Number::RangeTracker class is used to keep track of
a set of numerical ranges. Ranges can be added to and removed from
this collection of ranges. Overlapping ranges are collapsed to form a
single, longer range. Ranges can be manipulated, examined, and output
in a variety of ways.

While some other modules associate values with a range of keys (see
["SEE ALSO"](#see-also)), the objective of Number::RangeTracker is to quickly and
easily monitor the integers on a number line that are covered by at
least one range. Number::RangeTracker performs significantly faster
than other modules that have similar functions (see ["SEE ALSO"](#see-also)).

- new

    Initializes a new Number::RangeTracker object.

- add( START, END )

    Add one or more ranges. This can be used multiple times to add ranges
    to the object. Ranges can be added in several ways. The following are
    equivalent.

        $range->add( [ 1, 10 ], [ 16, 20 ] );
        $range->add( 1, 10, 16, 20 );
        $range->add( '1..10', '16..20' );

- remove( START, END )

    Remove one or more ranges from the current set of ranges. This can be
    used multiple times to remove ranges from the object. Ranges can be
    removed with the same syntax used for adding ranges.

- collapse

    When ranges are added or removed, overlapping ranges are not collapsed
    until necessary. This allows range Number::RangeTracker to be very
    fast.

    Ranges can be manually collapsed to avoid memory issues when
    working with very large amounts of ranges. In one test, a million
    overlapping ranges required ~100 MB of memory. This requirement was
    cut drastically by collapsing ranges after every 100,000th range was
    added.

    Ranges are automatically collapsed (and merged or removed where
    appropriate) (1) before ranges are added (if there are ranges still
    waiting to be removed) and (2) before each of the following methods is
    executed.

- length

    Returns the total length of all ranges combined.

- size

    Returns the total number of elements (i.e., integers) of all ranges.

- is\_in\_range( VALUE )

    Test whether a VALUE is contained within one of the ranges. Returns 0
    for a negative result. Returns a list of three numbers for a positive
    result: 1, start position of the containing range, end position of the
    containing range.

- output

    Returns all ranges sorted by their start positions. In list context,
    returns a list of all ranges sorted by start positions. This is
    suitable for populating a hash, an array, or even another range
    object. In scalar context, returns a string of ranges formatted as:
    `1..10,16..20`.

- integers

    Returns each integer contained within the ranges. In list context,
    returns a sorted list. In scalar context, returns a sorted,
    comma-delimited string of integers.

- complement( UNIVERSE\_START, UNIVERSE\_END )

    Returns the complement of a set of ranges. The output is in list
    context sorted by range start positions.

        my $original_range = Number::RangeTracker->new;
        $original_range->add( [ 11, 20 ], [ 41, 60 ], [ 91, 110 ] );

        my %complement = $original_range->complement;
        # -inf => 10,
        # 21   => 40,
        # 61   => 90,
        # 111  => +inf

    UNIVERSE\_START and UNIVERSE\_END can be used to specify a finite subset
    of the 'universe' of numbers (defaults are -/+ infinity. The
    complement ranges are bounded by these values.

        %complement = $original_range->complement( 1, 50 );
        # 1  => 10,
        # 21 => 40

    A new object with the complement of a set of ranges can be created
    quickly and easily.

        my $complement_range = Number::RangeTracker->new;
        $complement_range->add( $original_range->complement );

# SEE ALSO

- Monitor the integers covered by at least one range

    Although there is some functional overlap between this module, [Number::Range](https://metacpan.org/pod/Number::Range), and [Range::Object::Serial](https://metacpan.org/pod/Range::Object::Serial), Number::RangeTracker is significantly faster.

    It takes less than one second for Number::RangeTracker to add 100,000 overlapping ranges. Over this same period of time, Number::Range and Range::Serial::Object are only able to add 1,000 and 300 ranges, respectively.

    Some tasks require even higher throughput. When adding 1 million overlapping ranges, Number::Range took >250 times as long as Number::RangeTracker (35 min 31 sec vs. 8 sec). Range::Object::Serial slows exponentially as ranges are added and, therefore, it was not feasible to test this many ranges.
